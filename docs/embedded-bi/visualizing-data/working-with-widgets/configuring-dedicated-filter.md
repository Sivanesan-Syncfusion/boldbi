# Dedicated filter customization in the widgets

Starting from Bold BI [`v3.3.88`](https://www.boldbi.com/release-history/enterprise/3-3#3-3-88) you can filter the data bind to the widget by using any of the fields present in the data source. You can use single or multiple fields to filter the widget data. 

**Example:**

Here the chart widget shows Product Category with high sales. Using Dedicated filters we can show the data of specific country, in this case we will be showing the data of `Germany` using the `Country` field.

*Chart widget: Shows the Categories with High Sales.* <br>
